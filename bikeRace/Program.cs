/*
1. Describe the purpose of the class you created and how a developer might use the class.   
--The purpose of the RaceGame class is to provide the programmer with the necessary method to create a race game like mine where a certain number of bikers race one another. It has the following methods: AddNames, AddDisplayChar, PrintRounds, ChangePositions, RoundResults, CheckForWinner, and DisplayResults. 
A developer might use this class if they want to create a race game that requires the user to input the names of the players, characters for those names, and display those names and characters in the result. 
2. Explain design considerations in selecting a menu vs a loop. If you use a menu, explain why you included or excluded different commands.  If you use a loop, explain why you didnâ€™t opt to use a menu.
--I chose to use a loop instead of a menu because there is no reason for the user to select many options while playing the game. The only two options they have is either to continue playing the game or quit. Using a loop is more compact. 
3. Explain design considerations in using static methods vs class methods to validate data and process the data.
--I used a statid methid with my public Rounds property because I needed my rounds to add up rather than having the system create new instances of Rounds every time. I used class methods the rest of the time because I needed my public properties to create new instances of itself.
4. Discuss any problems you encountered when creating the project and how you resolved them. 
--I was getting an error in the RoundResults methods when I entered a white space because I was trying to convert the user's input (string) into a character. So, if I entered a white space, then the conversion would result into an error, as it is impossible to convert a white space into a character. I asked ChatGPT and it suggested that I add "!string.IsNullOrEmpty(enter)" into my if statement, and it solved the error because the if statement would only execute if the user did not input a white space and enter "q". Not only did ChatGPT suggest this, but it also suggested a few other ones that I understood and some that I did not. AddNames and AddDisplayChar || instead of &&.
