                                    <li>Seeing magnificent slot canyons on the Navajo Nation takes some advance planning. A permit and a tour guide are required to explore this special place. Several authorized tour operators lead small groups to the canyons and share their knowledge about the area’s history and geology.</li>
                                    <li>While the terrain in the area is mostly flat, sand and sandstone surfaces make hiking more difficult than expected. Upper Antelope Canyon is the easier section to navigate, with ground-level entry to the slot canyons. Upon exiting the canyon, visitors take a 20-minute trek on sandy trails back to the parking area. Lower Antelope Canyon takes more stamina to explore, requiring a longer hike to reach the canyons and several stairways and ladders to get into the dramatic rock formations. Experienced hikers can get more trail time on the Page Rimview Trail, which runs nearly 10 miles and passes dramatic viewpoints overlooking the canyonlands plus Glen Canyon and Lake Powell.</li>
                                    <li>Antelope Canyon is one of the most photographed destinations in the Southwest. Guided tours are offered year-round, but photographers time their visits to arrive at the canyon midday March through October. That’s when the position of the sun creates light shafts that reach the canyon floor and illuminates pink, orange and gold patterns on the canyon walls. Winter colors are more muted but no less spectacular. Upper Antelope Canyon offers photography tours with limited participants so groups can take more time setting up and capturing the perfect shots.</li>

The duration and intensity of colors and scents vary from year to year. The wildflower season generally lasts from as early as mid-February through May, with a variety of wildflowers creating a mosaic of color that changes daily.</li>
                                    <li>Eight miles of trails through the gentle rolling hills, including a paved section for wheelchair access, make the park a wonderful place to hike and explore any season. Get away from the city and relax in the quietude of the countryside, with the birds singing and hawks gliding silently overhead. Benches located along the trails make good places to sit quietly and watch for wildlife, such as meadow larks, lizards, and gopher snakes. If you're lucky, you may spot a coyote or bobcat. Numerous burrows around the trails may shelter mice, gophers, kangaroo rats, beetles, scorpions, or others.</li>

                                    <li>The Atchafalaya Basin is the nation's largest river swamp, containing almost one million acres of America's most significant bottomland hardwoods, swamps, bayous and backwater lakes. The basin begins near Simmesport, La., and stretches 140 miles southward to the Gulf of Mexico. Currently, the Atchafalaya Basin is bound by natural ridges formed by levee building along active and abandoned courses of the Mississippi River.</li>
                                    <li>Over the past 10,000 years or more, the Mississippi River has changed its path several times, ranging from the current location of Bayou Teche to today’s route past Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The Atchafalaya River runs down the middle of that traditional Mississippi floodplain and would probably be the main channel of the Mississippi by now, if not for the Old River Control Structure[s] near Simmesport.</li>
                                    <li>Formerly the lower section of the Red River, the Atchafalaya River became much smaller after the Red joined the Mississippi in the 15th century. By the 19th century, the Atchafalaya was blocked by a huge log raft, as were parts of the Red.</li>
